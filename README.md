# TriDepth

The official Pytorch implementation of the paper "[Self-Supervised Monocular Depth Estimation: Solving the Edge-Fattening Problem]()" (**WACV 2023**)

We introduce **TriDepth**, a high-performance depth estimator with a highly generalizable redesigned triplet loss.

### Note: The pretrained models and other necessary data for reproducing our results will be released when the paper is publicly available.
